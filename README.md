# Events Around You - Backend

This is the repository for the backend of the "Events Around You" application, an application for managing events in the vicinity.

## Technologies Used

The backend has been developed using Java and the Spring Boot framework. The main technologies used include:

- Spring Boot: A Java framework for creating web applications and RESTful APIs.
- Spring Data JPA: A framework that simplifies database interaction through the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) paradigm.
- Spring Security: A Spring module that handles authentication and authorization within the application.
- PostgreSQL: An open-source relational database management system.
- Lombok: A Java library that simplifies code writing by reducing verbosity.
- JavaFaker: A Java library for generating fake data (e.g., for testing or demo purposes).
- ModelMapper: A Java library that simplifies object mapping between different data structures.
- JJWT: A Java library for handling JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
